Product Browsing: Browse a wide range of products with detailed descriptions, prices, and images.
Personalized Recommendations: Get personalized product recommendations based on user behavior and preferences using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Shopping Cart: Add products to the cart, view cart details, and proceed to checkout.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Machine Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for product recommendations
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
MongoDB installed and running
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sreeman2k4/clickcart.git

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Machine Learning for Recommendations
The product recommendation system is implemented using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It analyzes user behavior and preferences to suggest products that are similar to what they have interacted with previously.

How It Works
Data Collection: User behavior data is collected, such as product views, purchases, and ratings.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the data to represent each product.
KNN Algorithm: Use the KNN algorithm to find products similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on the features extracted.
Recommendations: Display the recommended products to the user on their dashboard and product pages.
